**IBM Sentimental Analysis of Restaurant Reviews**

This repository contains code and resources for performing sentimental analysis of restaurant reviews using IBM's Watson Natural Language Understanding service.

Sentimental analysis is a natural language processing technique that can be used to identify and extract opinions and sentiment from text. This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as understanding customer satisfaction, tracking public opinion, and identifying trends.

The code in this repository provides a simple example of how to use the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding service to perform sentimental analysis of restaurant reviews. The code uses the Python programming language and the IBM Watson Natural Language Understanding client library for Python.

To use the code, you will need to create an IBM Cloud account and obtain an API key for the Watson Natural Language Understanding service. Once you have an API key, you can update the `credentials.json` file in this repository with your API key.

Once you have updated the credentials file, you can run the `analyze_reviews.py` script to perform sentimental analysis of the restaurant reviews in the `reviews.csv` file. The script will generate a new file called `results.csv` that contains the results of the analysis, including the sentiment and confidence score for each review.

You can also use the Jupyter Notebook file in this repository to explore the results of the sentimental analysis. The notebook provides a visualization of the sentiment distribution for the restaurant reviews.

**Use cases**

* Understanding customer satisfaction with a restaurant
* Tracking public opinion on a particular restaurant or chain of restaurants
